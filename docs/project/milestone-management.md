# Milestone management

[Milestones](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/milestones) are used to prioritize items.

- Place unplanned issues in `Future`.
- Place planned/WIP/done issues in `major.x`.
- When a new version is released, create a corresponding milestone `major.minor.patch` and move closed issues there.
